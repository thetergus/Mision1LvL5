Buying Experience Re-design at Turners Car Insurance

The Client
Turners Car Auctions is a market leader in the automotive industry in New Zealand, responsible for more than 10% of all used vehicle sales in the country. It has retained its original function as a vehicle auctioneer, operating in 19 branches nationwide, but has become increasingly dependent on a parallel role as a conventional used vehicle dealership. In support of that role, it has established in-house finance and vehicle insurance divisions that allow it to offer buyers a complete “one-stop shop” experience.

The Project Brief
Turners is currently undertaking a major re-design of its motor vehicle insurance systems and processes, including an investigation of ways in which the introduction of new technologies can enhance the buyer experience. Here is some information about motor vehicle insurance at Turners [https://www.turners.co.nz/Cars/finance-insurance/car-insurance/].  You have just been assigned to work on this project to help create a new insurance buying experience.



**Task 1. Identify Stakeholders**
For this project, the stakeholders most impacted  are the following

    *What is the expected delivery date (if there is one)for the project, for a mockup, for a prototype, for the MVP.
    *Do we have datasets for this project, or of similar projects that have been deployed in similar environments? Use them to reference our priorities & foresee as many obstacles as we can, as early possible.

- Allocating Resources through data & analyzis
    *Technologies and tools used might affect the workhours requred to get parts done according to the current skillsets avaiable.
    *Analyzing and assesing risk no latter than this point, ensuring expectations  & workhours align, specially on more rigid projects (budget &/or time)

- Teams & communication pathways are established & available
